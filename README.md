# SpliceJunctionPrediction
Used feature engineering techniques discussed in Zou et al. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0295-5) and implemented a 1D CNN for splice junction prediction. Dataset was obtained from UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+(Splice-junction+Gene+Sequences)).
